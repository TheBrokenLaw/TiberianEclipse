TiberianEclipse
=====================
A mod to bring the atmosphere of Tiberian Sun and Firestorm into Minecraft. 

Overview
==========
At this moment, this mod adds the various types of Tiberium as minable ores that drop shards. These shards can then be smelted to gain Refined Tiberium. The only purpose of this at the moment is to craft the Refined Tiberium block. 
There are so few active Command and Conquer projects these days, and the only others relating to Minecraft are long dead. I will not let this die without being fully completed first. 

Please keep in mind this is not an attempt to port the whole essence of CnC. The grittiness of the world, sure, the hopelessness in the face of a cataclysm, absolutely, but not battles. I may include the ruins of bases, but active battles with units are probably not going to happen unless I get bored.

As well, this will not remain one singular mod forever. I will split it into various modules, so if people can mix and match what they want out of it.

Future Plans
============
Tiberium Fields that change the world around them.
 - Currently, plan is to find a way to create a biome, make it spread itself, and find a way to slow its growth as it expands.
 - Fields of all four types will exist, though Riparius and Vinifera patches will be the most common by far. 
 - Hopefully I can find some method to mature some of the crystals in a given field as it grows, and then have that crystal begin       converting the field to its type.
 - As field value goes up, crystal spread goes down. This means that if you are lucky enough to find a patch of Vinifera, or have some evolve in a field you control, you will have to carefully consider harvesting it versus cultivation.
 - Tiberium generates Tiberium pollution, which can cause severe health problems in living creatures and severe weather disturbances. I.E. as pollution in an area increases, animals die off and the occasional ion storm occurs.

Blue, yellow, and red zones
 - Initially the world will be Tiberium-free, but after it arrives the world will begin its metamorphosis.
 - Minimal Tiberium contamination in a contiguous area will define the area as a blue zone. Plants and animals are common, and clean water flows freely. Riparius fields are rare, but may still occur.
 - Moderate contamination creates yellow zones, areas that are dead or dying and have common Riparius fields. Vinifera is uncommon.
 - Extreme contamination defines a red zone, wherein Tiberium has completely taken over the landscape. Strange creatures roam the lands, and odd plant-like growths sprout. The rarer crystal varieties exist here.
 -Hopefully I can use the Tiberium pollution as some method for classifying these zones, and allow the zones themselves to spread.
 - Each zone has its own variety of biomes, blue being standard minecraft with the addition of blue-zone Tiberium field biomes. 
 - The moon undergoes a transformation as the world changes, and at a similiar rate. Hence, by looking at the moon, you can tell at a glance how bad things are (or will be soon, or was shortly).

Tiberium  harvesting, refining, and utilization
 - Ideally Tiberium will be able to be used to create and fuel large production chains and research lines.
 - Thaumcraft-like research utilizing Tiberium.
 - Harvesting Tiberium by hand without a protective suit will have drastic consequences, so automated harvesting is a must. I mean to implement some form of automated havester that travels to nearby fields and harvests, to return to a refinery drop-off multiblock. 
 -Tiberium refining and the production of Tiberium-based equipment will be handled by large multiblock machines. 
 
 Ruins
  - This may not happen for some time
  - Extremely rare Scrin towers exist at the heart of massive red zones. Deep in the heart of these intimidating structures lies a portal. Without extensive research, this portal sends you to a world in the midst of its own Tiberium cataclysm. 
  -GDI and NOD bases will exist here in various forms of disrepair and neglect (Pristine, neglected, ruined, overtaken, rubble). 
  -Bases randomly have an assortment of buildings (ConYard, powerplants, barracks, warfactory, defensive structures, walls, gates, tech centers, etc.)
  -Bases will be of various types and sizes (outpost, economic, multipurpose, and research) (small, medium, large, expansive, and regional headquarters) 
  - Civilian outposts with their own assortment of buildings.
  - Very rarely, in Pristine research bases a certain artifact may be found... (If I can figure out how to ensure that one and only one exists at a time. Throw it in lava, youll have to go look for another.)
 
Lore
- The Tiberium universe oft has its lore mangled. I hope to avoid that. I do not consider anything past Tiberium Wars to be canon, and even then I disagree with many changes that EA made there. Hence, the pod Tiberium instead of the large crystals. 
- Most of what I want to include here involve the ruins in some way shape or form. Valuable research items can be found and analyzed, providing bits and pieces of lore.
- There will be an overarching storyline as you progress through the mod. Or, rather, as the Tiberium progresses.
- Generally, storytelling in mods boils down to books and notes. I hope to find some way to spice this up a bit here.

Integration with other mods
- This is huge. From the get-go Tiberian Eclipse will be compatible with as many tech mods as I can find, starting with the big ones first. 
- Willing to take suggestions on this part. I am unsure as to how to integrate with other mods well as of yet.
